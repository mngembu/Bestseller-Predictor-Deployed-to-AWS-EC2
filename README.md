# Predicting Bestseller Novels on Amazon.com

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project will explore and analyze data from 'novels' search term on amazon.com at any point in time, and will culminate in building and deploying a machine learning model to predict whether or not a novel will become an amazon bestseller based on certain attributes.

This is an end to end machine learning project from scratch. It involves: <br>
- data collection through web scraping (building the web scraper from scratch) <br>
- data cleaning and transformation <br>
- data exploration <br>
- data analysis <br>
- training a predictive ML model on the data to predict whether a novel is a bestseller <br>
- deploying the model within a flask web application on my local host <br>
- deploying the flask web application to the cloud using AWS' EC2
